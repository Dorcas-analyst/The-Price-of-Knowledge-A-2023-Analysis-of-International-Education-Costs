# The-Price-of-Knowledge-A-2023-Analysis-of-International-Education-Costs
This analysis explores the Cost of International Education Dataset, which compiles detailed financial information from universities around the world.
--- 

### Overview
A global data analysis exploring the true cost of studying abroad ‚Äî from tuition to rent, living costs, visa, and insurance.
The project highlights affordability trends and financial insights across 900+ international universities.
 - üìä Tools Used: Excel (Dashboards, Charts, Pivot Tables)
 - üìÅ Dataset: Kaggle ‚Äî Cost of International Education Dataset
 - üìÖ Year: 2023 | üî¢ Rows: 908 | Columns: 12

### Objective
To analyze global education costs and identify affordability drivers that influence students‚Äô study-abroad decisions.

### Data Cleaning & Transformation
1. Removed duplicates, blanks, and inconsistent entries.
2. Created calculated fields:
 - Monthly_Estimated_Living_Cost = $1,850 √ó (Living Index / 123.3)
 - Annual_Living_Cost = Monthly √ó 12
 - Exchange_Rate_Category = Strong / Medium / Weak
3. Standardized all costs to USD and rounded for clarity.

### Key Insights

 - Emphasize ROI over prestige when guiding students.

For Scholarship Boards
 - Target high-cost, high-impact fields (AI, Data Science, Eng.).
 - Support students in underrepresented, emerging economies.

Limitations
1. Data from 2021‚Äì2023 ‚Äî may not reflect latest 2025 rates.
2. Excludes non-financial barriers (visa denial, living culture).
